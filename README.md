# Sessions Typed Bidirectionally

A look at typing multiparty sessions using multiparty session types and bidirectional typing.

This work originated from Capable, developed as part of the DSbD AppControl project.

This work provides proof that the ideas of bidirectionally typed multiparty sessions are sound and complete.


A constant work in progress.....
